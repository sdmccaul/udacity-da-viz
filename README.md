# Ford GoBike / Lyft Bay Wheels Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of 24 CSV files available here:

It details information for individual rides taken by customers of the
San Francisco-area bike share program from mid-2017 to the present.
The data includes information related to bike location, ride-start and
ride-end times, and anonymized rider demographic information. More information

## Summary of Findings

I was expecting to find a variable dataset that was primarily defined by
seasonality and work schedules. While these influences were apparent, the
data revealed some interesting and surprising trends. While ridership is
steadily increasing since 2017, other usage statistics are relatively flat.
Trip durations and distances show a strong central tendency, with trip
locations concentrated in a few areas. Similarly, riders are overwhelmingly
male and in young adulthood, 20-40 years old. Ridership is most frequent
on weekdays, during commuter hours, in downtown San Francisco. Riders are
mostly subscribers rather than casual customers. These tendencies were evident
in 2017, and have only grown stronger over the past 2 years.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The main insight is that the bikeshare program is used by a very specific
group of people, in very specific ways. While the program is popular, and
increasing in popularity, that popularity is limited to a dedicated
subscriber base. That subscribership is itself limited to mostly young men,
moving around downtown San Francisco. As the program continues, it might focus
on building up ridership in new areas, among new types of users.
